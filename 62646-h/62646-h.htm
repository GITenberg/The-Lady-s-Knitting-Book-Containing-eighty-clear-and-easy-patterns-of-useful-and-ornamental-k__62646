<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> sending this little work before the public, I have tried
to remedy one fault which I have often heard complained
of, namely, that knitting-books generally give so many more
stitches than are really required. This is partly owing to
the different qualities of wool used by different knitters,
and partly also, to a certain extent, whether the worker
knits loosely or tightly. The following directions are for
medium knitters. As knitting sometimes shrinks in the
washing, I should advise my readers to try and knit moderately
loose. But, of course, the principal thing is to have
the same sized wool or silk as that for which the directions
are given; and this is especially important in socks and
stockings. I will therefore state that Charity wheeling is
the thickest and most harsh kind of yarn made; Scotch
wheeling is a trifle less coarse. Scotch fingering is the
usual yarn sold for socks and gentlemen’s stockings: it
ought to be very strong, and to appear about the same size<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>{viii}</span>
as Berlin. If it looks finer (and some does) put on more
stitches than are given. For couvrettes, and things of that
kind, the size of the wool and pins is, of course, a matter of
less importance, as it does not signify whether the work is
a trifle larger or smaller than intended; but in stockings, a
slight thing makes a good deal of difference in the fit.</p>

<p>I have also endeavoured to explain everything at full
length, so as to enable inexperienced knitters to find out
the patterns by themselves; the cost of each article is put,
whenever possible, at the head of the pattern.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>{9}</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EXPLANATIONS">EXPLANATIONS.</h2>
</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">To</span> purl or pearl’ and ‘to seam’ mean the same thing; that is,
to put the wool round the right-hand needle. Thus: the wool
hangs straight down, it must be lifted and placed round the
needle from right to left. You must then insert the right-hand
needle into the stitch, exactly the opposite way as in ordinary
knitting.</p>

<p>‘To decrease’ is simply to knit two stitches together. Another
way is to slip a stitch, knit one, pass the slipped stitch
over it.</p>

<p>‘To take two together’ means to knit two together.</p>

<p>‘To increase,’ you must knit both into the lower part of the
stitch, and also into the stitch itself.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Stockings_and_Socks"><i>Stockings and Socks.</i></h2>
</div>


<p>The directions given for silk stockings are worked with
Adams and Co.’s silk, 5 New Street, Bishopsgate Street, E. It
is very good, and of lovely colours. Patterns are sent free, and
all orders can be sent by post. Any uncommon shade can be
dyed to order, provided it be not for less than 1 lb. of silk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>{10}</span></p>

<p>The prices are as follow:—Imperial knitting-silk, the best
quality, any colour, 3<i>s.</i> per 2 oz. skein. Filoselle, any colour,
2<i>s.</i> per oz., or 3<i>d.</i> per skein of 15 yards. Embroidery silk, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per oz. Knitting-pins, 2<i>d.</i> per set of four. These knitting-silks
are guaranteed fast colours, and are beautifully bright and
soft.</p>

<p>Those of my readers who prefer a coarser knitting-silk will
be glad to hear that Mr. Adams is now making some.</p>


<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak" id="General_remarks"><i>General Remarks on Socks and Stockings.</i></h2></div>

<p>For a lady’s stocking it is best to decrease once and increase
three times for the calf of the leg. For a gentleman’s this is
unnecessary. Most of these directions are for ribbed stockings,
as they fit so much better; but if preferred plain, of course the
same number of stitches is required.</p>

<p>You must always remember in ribbed stockings to carry on
the ribs and seam-stitches all down the back of the heel, until
you begin to round it. The ribs on the front of the foot must be
continued straight on, until within an inch of the decreasing for
the toe.</p>

<p>The seam-stitch is made by knitting a certain stitch in two
rounds and pearling it in the third.</p>

<p>Before decreasing for the instep, do two or three plain rounds
and then begin.</p>

<p>The ‘flap,’ or heel before it is rounded, ought to be three
inches, or even more, as a long heel wears better. It also makes
it much stronger to knit it double with Angola wool, of the same
colour as the knitting; it can be bought at any linen-draper’s on
wooden reels for 2<i>d.</i> One reel does a pair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>{11}</span></p>

<p>Except for young boys, socks fit quite well without being
decreased at all for the ankle; therefore I only give one pattern

<p>To inexperienced knitters the heel seems to present mountains
of difficulty, but in reality the mountain is but a mole-hill
after all. The following pattern is one of the best.</p>

<p>Divide your stitches. We will say you have 50 altogether,
on three needles: take 12 on each side of the seam-stitch, and
knit these 25 backwards and forwards in rows, not rounds
(making the seam-stitch all the same); you must pearl backwards,
so as to keep the knitting even. Continue until you have
made a flap about three inches long, always slipping the first
knitted stitch. Now knit, from the right-hand side, the 12
stitches; then the seam-stitch, which from this time forward you
cease to make. Knit 4 stitches beyond it; knit 2 together;
knit 1; turn, pearl until you get to 4 beyond the seam-stitch,
pearl 2 together, pearl 1, turn. Knit until you come to the
stitch in the previous row where you turned—you may know it
easily by the little hole which was formed by the turning; you
now knit 2 together and knit one more stitch, then turn. Pearl
the next row, of course always pearling 2 together where the
little hole has been left, and so on until you have gradually
worked off the stitches. You then pick up the side-stitches of
this flap and the heel is finished.</p>

</div>

<p>Put half your stitches on one needle, a quarter on the second,
and a quarter on the third needle. Thus: suppose you have 60
stitches, you must have 30 on one side and 15 on the other two.
The 30 must be the front or ribbed part, the two pins with 15
stitches on them ought to be the sole part. In doubling your
knitting now, the front part ought to lie evenly on the sole of
the foot. Begin to knit the 30 stitches; knit 27, slip 1, knit 1,
pass the slipped stitch over, knit 1. Now begin the next pin;
knit 1, knit 2 together. Continue plain knitting. Now begin
the 3rd pin; knit 12, slip 1, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over,
knit 1. Now you begin again on the 30. Knit 1, knit 2 together.
Continue plain. Do two rounds plain, and then decrease again
in the same manner 4 stitches in every round, leaving always 2
stitches between the decreasing, remembering always to do two
rounds of plain knitting between each decreasing round.</p>

<p>Repeat for two inches and cast off.</p>

<p>Some people only do one round between the decreasing:
this plan makes the toe rounder and more puckered.</p>

<p>On the right-hand side of the heel, just where the ribs leave
off, you slip 1, knit 1; pass the slipped stitch over; continue
plain knitting; and where the ribs begin again you knit 2
together. You must remember that on the right side of the
heel you slip, and on the left that you knit 2 together.</p>

<p>Cast on 128 stitches in black, do 12 rounds of 2 plain, 2
pearl. Now make the first stitch the seam-stitch, and do plain
knitting until 4 inches are done, making the stripes come quite
evenly, one inch broad. When you have once joined the rose-coloured,
let the black thread hang down inside the seam-stitch;
do not break off every time you change colour, which must
always take place at the seam-stitch. Now do 3 plain and 1
pearl alternately. When 5½ inches are done decrease on each

pass the colour you are not using at the back; always change

knit 3 and pearl 1. Continue to knit 3 and pearl 1 every row
until 12½ inches are done. Then begin to decrease every 8
rows. You decrease on the right-hand side of the seam-stitch
by slipping a stitch, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over. Work
the seam-stitch and knit 2 together. If the stitch to be slipped
happens to be a pearl stitch, you must not slip it but merely
pearl two together on both sides. You will thus decrease 16

have 12 stitches on now. Then cast off. These ribs ought to

ribs as before, only this time you do not begin to decrease at the

11 ribs and cast off. Cast off the remaining stitches, and proceed
as before with the last 18 for the fourth shoulder-piece.</p>

<p>Now sew up these two sides until you get to within 24 rows
from the top of the front piece, which is the shortest. You must
now join the rest with a gusset, which you form by picking up
one stitch, knit it and turn; in every row you must now take up
one stitch, and rib them the same as the other part of the
vest in 3 and 3. Thus, the first row you have 1 stitch, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>{32}</span>

<p>This knitting leaves loops on one side, and is very pretty and
warm for quilts, couvrettes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Cast on, in 6-thread fleecy and pins No. 7, any number of
stitches. Do not slip the first stitch, but always knit it.</p>

<p>First row—plain knitting.</p>

<p>Second row—put the wool round the needle as if you were
going to knit a plain stitch, but instead of knitting let the wool
hang straight down over the forefinger of the left hand; wind it
round and put it for the second time over the right needle.
Wind the wool a second time round the finger, and for the third
time put it round the needle; and now knit this stitch, which
ought to have the appearance of three in one. Repeat. The
next row plain. Do about six rows plain and then repeat with
the loops; of course you must only make them on one side of
the knitting, and they will require a little pulling to keep them
in the right place. This is handsome in stripes of shaded red.</p>

and for the 3rd and front breadth you must, after the first 12
rounds, decrease at the beginning and end of each row about
every two inches. If you do not like to have a gored breadth
do this one exactly the same as the other two. Crochet some
scalloped edges round the bottom of the petticoat, after having
joined the breadths together. These petticoats are beautifully
warm and last for a long time. Summer ones can be knitted
with the same pins in Scotch wheeling-yarn or 2-thread fleecy,
which are much cheaper but not so nice and soft. It makes a
charming finish to put a border as on <a href="#Page_44">page 44</a>. You need only

make lengthway ribs. When half a square is done decrease at

are finished join together with a square piece of calico between
each knitted one. Thus: take a piece of calico, turn down the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>{43}</span>

the two edges together. Then sew the knitting and the calico
together, as if you were doing patchwork. The raw edges of

<p>This may sound difficult, but it is really quite the reverse, as

<p>Fifth row—knit 2, thread forward, slip 1, knit 1, pass slipped
over, knit 2 together, thread forward, knit 1. Repeat.</p>

<p>Seventh row—knit 2 together, knit 2, thread forward, knit 3.
Repeat.</p>

<p>Ninth row—knit 2 together, knit 1, thread forward, knit 1,
thread forward, knit 1, slip 1, knit 1, pass slipped over. Repeat.</p>

<p>Eleventh row—knit 2 together, thread forward, knit 3, thread
forward, slip 1, knit 1, pass slipped over. Repeat.</p>

<p>The next row pearled. Recommence from first row.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Honeycomb.</i>—Small holes. Cast on 6 for each pattern.</p>

<p>First row—pearl 1, putting the thread before the needle
twice, pearl 2 together. Repeat.</p>

<p>Third row—pearl 2 together, thread before the needle, pearl 1.
Repeat.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Another Pattern.</i>—Cast on 8 for each.</p>

<p>First row—thread forward, slip 1, knit 1, pass the slipped
over. Repeat.</p>

<p>Third row—thread forward, slip 1, knit 1, pass the slipped
over, knit 6. Repeat.</p>


<p class="p2"><i><a id="Brioche"></a>Brioche.</i>—Cast on any number of stitches in threes, 21, 30,
36, according to the desired width. * Thread before the needle,
knit 2 together, slip 1. Repeat from *.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Nice Pattern for the Tops of Socks.</i>—5 stitches for each
pattern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>{56}</span></p>

<p>First row—pearl 2, keep the thread over the needle, knit 3
together, thread over. Repeat.</p>

<p>Second row—pearl 3, knit 2. Repeat.</p>

<p>Third row—pearl 2, knit 3. Repeat.</p>

<p>Fourth row—like the second.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Very pretty little Pattern.</i>—First row—knit 2, thread
forward, slip 1, knit 1, pass slipped over. Repeat.</p>

<p>Second row—Pearl 2, thread over, pearl 2 together. Repeat
these rows alternately.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Another.</i>—Cast on six for each pattern.</p>

<p>First row—pearl 1, take 2 together, thread forward, knit 1,
thread forward, slip 1, knit 1, pass the slipped over. Repeat.</p>

<p>Second row—pearl 5, knit 1. These two rows alternately.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Another.</i>—Cast on 8 for each pattern.</p>

<p>First row.—Take 2 together, thread forward, knit 2, thread
forward, slip 1, knit 1, pass the slipped over, knit 2. Repeat.
Every other row is—pearl 4, pearl 2 together, thread over,
pearl 2.</p>

<p>Third row.—Take 2 together, thread forward, knit 3, thread
forward, slip 1, knit 1, pass the slipped over, knit 1. Repeat.</p>

<p>Fifth row—Take 2 together, thread forward, knit 4, thread
forward, slip 1, knit 1, pass the slipped over. Repeat.</p>

<p>By this time my readers will perceive how much alteration
can be made by merely reversing, and slightly altering, the
position of knitted, pearled, and slipped stitches, and will
doubtless be able to invent many more equally pretty patterns
for themselves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="High_Bodice_to_cost_1s_3d"><i>High Bodice, to cost 1s. 3d.</i></h2>
</div>


<p>This bodice is meant to wear under the dress. Three skeins
scarlet merino and pins No. 5, or Shetland wool and pins No. 7.</p>

<p>Cast on 98 stitches, and rib with 2 plain, 2 pearl, for 12 rows.</p>

<p>Thirteenth row—knit 16, make 1 (by putting the wool round
the needle), knit 30, make 1, knit 6, make 1, knit 30, make 1,
knit 16.</p>

<p>Fourteenth row—Plain knitting.</p>

<p>Fifteenth row—knit 17, make 1, knit 30, make 1, knit 8, make
1, knit 30, make 1, knit 17.</p>

<p>Sixteenth row—Plain knitting.</p>

<p>Seventeenth row—knit 18, make 1, knit 30, make 1, knit 10,
make 1, knit 30, make 1, knit 18.</p>

<p>Eighteenth row—plain. Continue in this way until you have
done 30 rows with holes and 30 alternate plain rows.</p>

<p>Now, for the front part take 60 stitches, leaving all the rest
still on the needle, and do plain knitting backwards and forwards
on those 60 for 32 rows.</p>

<p>Thirty-third row—cast off 5 stitches, knit the rest plain.</p>

<p>Thirty-fourth row—you must now reduce for the neck at the
end of this row by taking 2 together.</p>

<p>Decrease thus every other row for 31 rows; you must have
39 stitches on your needle. Cast off; this part is for the
shoulder.</p>

<p>Cast off 16 stitches under the arm.</p>

<p>For the back take 66 stitches, and do 16 rows of plain
knitting; then 38 rows, decreasing for the shoulder at the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>{58}</span>
of each row. Now cast off 28 stitches for the neck. Cast off 16
under the other arm. Now take the remaining 60 stitches for
the second front, and do 32 rows as on the other side. Reduce
for the neck in the same manner, by casting off 5 at the 32nd
row, and then decreasing at the end of every alternate row for
32 rows. Cast off; there ought to be 39 stitches.</p>

<p>Sew the shoulders together, crochet round the neck and
sleeves (1 treble, 2 chain), and run ribbon or crocheted chain
round the former.</p>

<p>If sleeves are desired, cast on about 48 stitches, and do ribs
of 3 and 3 the desired length.</p>

<p>The following diagram will render the explanations easier:—</p>

<div class="figcenter illow500" id="i058" >
  <img src="images/i058.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>{59}</span></p>

<p>A good plan to prevent the front part from stretching too
much is, at every 10th row to leave the last 10 stitches before
the end unknitted.</p>

<p>This pattern is for an ordinary figure, but after one trial the
knitter will find it can be altered to any size.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Babys_Jacket"><i>Baby’s Jacket.</i></h2>
</div>


<p>Pins No. 9, and fleecy or fingering-wool.</p>

<p>Cast on 36, knit 5 plain rows.</p>

<p>Sixth row—knit 4, make 1, knit the remainder. The next
row plain.</p>

<p>Eighth row—knit 5, make 1, the rest plain. Continue in this
way to make holes each time one stitch further from the edge
until 13 holes are done. Then do 6 rows, decreasing once in
every row, at the 6th from the edge, on the side where the holes
are: this part goes under the arm. Now cast it off, leaving 32
stitches on the needle for the chest; knit these 32 for 22 rows,
and then decrease (at the opposite side to where you cast off) for
20 rows, thus making 10 decreasings; knit 3 plain rows and
cast off. Do another piece in the same way, and for the back
cast on 22 and knit 5 plain rows: this part is for the neck.</p>

<p>Sixth row—knit 4, increase; knit to within 4 of the end, and
increase again; knit the remaining 4.</p>

<p>Seventh row—plain knitting.</p>

<p>Do these alternately for 26 rows until you have 48 stitches;
knit 16 rows; then knit 1, take 2 together, take 2 together, make
1; plain to within 5 of the end where you make 1, take 2 together,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>{60}</span>
2 together again, knit the last. The next row plain.
Repeat these two rows alternately 12 times, then do 24 plain
rows and cast off.</p>

<p>For the neck, pick up about 40 stitches in scarlet and do 4
rows of ribbed knitting. Pick up 100 for the waist and do 8
rows plain, also with scarlet, and 2 rows up the front. Finish
off with large buttons and elastic loops, and either knit 4 rows
(like the neck) round the sleeves, or put long ones. For the
latter cast on 40 stitches and knit 7 inches. Rib 20 rows in
scarlet for the wrist.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Childs_Gaiter_to_cost_1s_2d"><i>Child’s Gaiter, to cost 1s. 2d.</i></h2>
</div>


<p>Three needles, No. 11 or 12, and 2 oz. brown Berlin wool.</p>

<p>Cast on 60 (for a very small child 54 will do), knit 3, pearl 3,
for 24 rows. Now do plain knitting for 12 rows, then decrease
at the beginning and end of the row. Continue plain knitting,
but you must decrease every five rows. When six decreasings
are done go on knitting until 78 rows are done.</p>

<p>Seventy-ninth row—knit 21 stitches, take the next 18 for the
instep on a third pin and knit backwards and forwards, decreasing
at the beginning and end after the first 2 rows. When
18 rows are done cast off.</p>

<p>Sew up the leg, and take up the rest of the stitches for the
heel. Do 10 rows, decreasing at the beginning and end of every
row. Cast off.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>{61}</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Round_Sofa-cushion"><i>Round Sofa-cushion.</i></h2>
</div>


<p>This can be worked in shades, or in any two colours which
contrast well.</p>

<p>Berlin and pins No. 14 may be used, casting on 54 stitches.
This is rather a small size; to make it larger use coarser wool,
and pins to correspond.</p>

<p>First row—plain knitting.</p>

<p>Second row—the rest of the cushion is done in <a href="#Brioche">Brioche
stitch</a>; leave the last 3 stitches unknitted, turn and go on with
the Brioche stitch.</p>

<p>Fourth row—leave the last 6 unknitted and turn.</p>

<p>Sixth row—leave the last 9 unknitted, and so on, 3 more
every time you get to the end of the row.</p>

<p>When you have worked off all the stitches, join the next
shade and knit the whole row. The next row like the 2nd.</p>

<p>This makes the knitting come into a gradual round. When
large enough sew it up and do a second in the same way. Make
a round pillow lined with feathers, and put between the knitting,
which must be sewn together like a silk pincushion. Draw in
the centre, which may be finished off with an ornamental button;
the edges can be crocheted or left plain, as preferred.</p>

<p>These cushions used to be very fashionable at one time,
although they are seldom seen now. However, fashions change
so quickly that they may, perhaps, be used again.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>{62}</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Knee-cap"><i>Knee-cap.</i></h2>
</div>


<p>These are very comfortable for people who are at all rheumatic.</p>

<p>Cast on 29 stitches with Berlin wool, knit 14, bring the wool
forward, knit the rest. Continue this until 28 rows are done.
Then knit 32 rows without increasing. Begin to decrease where
you took the wool forward at the 14th stitch by knitting 2 together.
Do 28 rows to correspond with the other side; have
29 stitches on your pin, the same as you began with. Cast off,
and sew the ends together.</p>

<p>The size of knee-caps must be regulated by the pins, and
also by the number of stitches used. Many people consider
them better when quite plain, without either increasing or decreasing.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Babys_Hood"><i>Baby’s Hood.</i></h2>
</div>


<p>Pins No. 9 and Berlin, or any other soft wool.</p>

<p>Cast on 60, and do 1 plain row. Then do Hood pattern,
<a href="#Hood_Pattern">page 50</a>, for 5 rows; then 6 rows of plain knitting. Do the rest
in any fancy stitch. When the knitting is 4 inches deep do 2
plain rows, 1 pearled, and cast off.</p>

<p>Cast on 22 stitches for the crown, do 1 plain row.</p>

<p>Second row—knit 1, thread over, take 2 together. Repeat;
6 more plain rows, and then any fancy stitch. When 3 inches
are done knit a row, decreasing at the beginning and end of
the row. Pearl the next, decreasing in the same way. Do 5
more rows in this manner, and cast off. Now sew the crown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>{63}</span>
and head parts together, gathering the fulness at the top, and
not at the sides.</p>

<p>Take up 74 stitches for the curtain, or neck part, and do 3
rows of alternate knitting and pearling; let the plain part come
on the right side.</p>

<p>In the second row increase after every 2 stitches, so as to
have about 110 altogether. When you have done 3 rows do
any open pattern for 2 inches, and cast off. Edge the hood all
round with a simple crochet edging in pink wool, and then
ribbon round the neck.</p>

<p>These hoods are very useful in grey wool for poor people.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
